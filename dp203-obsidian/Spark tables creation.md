In-memory tables are temporary and are stored in memory, making them suitable for quick data exploration and analysis.

### 2. Creating Persistent Tables

Persistent tables are stored on disk and survive Spark application restarts, making them suitable for long-term storage and sharing across multiple Spark sessions.
