The act of manipulating an existing feature to the needs of a machine learning model.
• Feature engineering is the process of creating new features from raw data to increase the predictive power of the machine learning model. 
• Engineered features capture additional information that is not available in the original feature set. 
• Examples of feature engineering are aggregating data, calculating a moving average, and calculating the difference over time
