A Computer Vision solution that trains an AI model to identify and assign part of an image to a category.

[[Product identification]] - performing visual searches for specific products in online searches or even, in-store using a mobile device. • 
[[Disaster investigation]] - evaluating key infrastructure for major disaster preparation efforts. For example, aerial surveillance images may show bridges and classify them as such. Anything classified as a bridge could then be marked for emergency preparation and investigation. • [[Medical diagnosis]] - evaluating images from X-ray or MRI devices could quickly classify specific issues found as cancerous tumors, or many other medical conditions related to medical imaging diagnosis

Sa machine learning based form of computer vision in which a model is trained to categorize images based on the primary subject matter they contain.
