A Computer Vision solution that can analyze faces within an image.

Some algorithms can also return other information, such as facial landmarks (nose, eyes, eyebrows, lips, and others).  
These facial landmarks can be used as features with which to train a machine learning model from which you can infer information about a person, such as their perceived age or perceived emotional state.
