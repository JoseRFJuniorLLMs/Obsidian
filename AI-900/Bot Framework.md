❑ [[Bots]] provide an experience that feels less like using a computer and more like dealing with a person - or at least an intelligent robot. 
❑ The bot reasons about input and performs relevant tasks. This can include asking the user for additional information or accessing services on behalf of the user , such as taking a dinner reservation or gathering profile information 
❑ Bots can do the same things other types of software can do - read and write files, use databases and APIs, and do the regular computational tasks. 
❑ Users converse with a bot using text, interactive cards, and speech. 
❑ A bot created with the [[Azure Bot Framework SDK ]]can be integrated with Language Understanding ([[LUIS]]), QnA Maker or Power Virtual agents.
